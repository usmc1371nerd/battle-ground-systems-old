# Battleground Communication Tool

Welcome to my React project creating a battleground communication tool. This is a project that may not have a significant use in the real world, but it allows me to create an app on something I know a little about. The idea of this project is to provide a tool that can be used by frontline combatants to communicate force numbers, equipment, contact with the enemy, and have tools easily available to ground troops.

- **Authentication**: Clerk

## Features
